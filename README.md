# Auto-GPT
Auto-GPT represents an innovative, open-source endeavor that serves as a compelling demonstration of the exceptional prowess of the GPT-4 language model. This cutting-edge application leverages the remarkable abilities of GPT-4 to interconnect a series of language-based "thoughts" and autonomously accomplish diverse objectives defined by the user. By showcasing the self-directed operation of GPT-4, Auto-GPT not only pushes the frontiers of artificial intelligence but also exemplifies the vast possibilities that can be achieved through this remarkable technology.

# Simple test to communicate with "gpt-3.5-turbo"
Run simple_gpt.py
import openai: This line imports the openai module, which allows us to interact with the OpenAI API and make requests to their models.

openai.api_key = "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": Here, we set the API key to authenticate our requests with OpenAI's services. This key is provided by OpenAI and is used to identify and authorize the user.

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write an essay about mobile phones"}]): This line creates a chat completion request using the OpenAI API. We use the openai.ChatCompletion.create() method to send a request to the GPT-3.5-turbo model. The messages parameter is a list of message objects, where each object represents a role (either "system", "user", or "assistant") and the content of the message. In this case, we have a single user message asking to write an essay about mobile phones.

print(completion.choices[0].message.content): Finally, we print the content of the response generated by the model. The completion.choices attribute contains a list of generated message objects. Since we only made a single completion request, we can access the first item in the list using [0]. Then, we access the message.content attribute to retrieve the actual generated essay text and print it to the console.
